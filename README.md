# Clustering-NBA-players-with-PCA
Data scrapped from the NBA's website. Over 100 variables in the dataset. PCA used to reduce dimensionality. K-means was the clustering method after testing multiple methods.

One notebook is for scrapping the multiple web pages on the NBA website. It also merges all the individual webpages into one dataset.

The second notebook contains a thorough exploration of the data in which we explore using PCA, as well as multiple clustering methods.

The powerpoint is an attempt at drawing insights from the clusters, but I have to admit my knowledge of basketball is limited. This project was more about the process!
